Other Location Expressions

Of course, zhèlǐ 这里 (here) and nàli 那里 (there) are not the only words used to indicate location. Here are some other location expressions that are a bit more specific:

qiánbian 前边 	in front of
hòubian 后边 	behind
pángbiān 旁边 	next to
shàngbian/shàng 上边/上 	on
lǐ/lǐbian 里/里边 	in, inside
wàibian 外边 	outside
xiàbian/xià 下边/下 	under
zuǒbian 左边 	on the left side of
yòubian 右边 	on the right side of
zhōngjiān 中间 	between
Typically, these location words are used along with the preposition zài 在 (in, on, at) to form larger, more specific location phrases. And just like time expressions, location expressions are always placed before the main verb.

zài 在 + noun + location word
When combined with zài 在, location words are usually preceded by a noun that helps to identify exactly where someone or something is situated. Occasionally, the noun can be omitted if you are indicating a general place or direction: Tā zài wàibian. 他在外边。(He’s outside.) But usually, the noun is required to help specify a precise location: Tā zài yínháng wàibian. 他在银行外边。(He’s outside the bank.) Most location phrases in Chinese are based on the resulting pattern: zài 在 + noun + location word.

Nà zhī māo zài yǐzi xiàbian.那只猫在椅子下边。 
The cat is under the chair.

Wǒ de shū zài zhuōzi shàngbian/shàng.我的书在桌子上边/上。 
My book is on the table.

Tā de xuéxiào zài gōngyuán pángbiān.他的学校在公园旁边。 
His school is next to the park.

Wáng xiānsheng zài Wáng xiǎojiě hòubian.王先生在王小姐后边。 
Mr. Wang is behind Miss Zhang.

Tāmen zài wàibian gōngzuò.他们在外边工作。 
They are working outside.

Wǒ xiànzài zài jiā lǐ xuéxí Zhōngwén.我现在在家里学习中文。 
I’m studying Chinese at home now.

Tā de māo xǐhuan zài shāfā shàng shuìjiào.她的猫喜欢在沙发上睡觉。 
Her cat likes to sleep on the sofa.

Wǒ de fángzi zài shāngdiàn yòubian.我的房子在商店右边。

Diànhuàjiān zài cānguǎn wàibian.电话间在餐馆外边。

Cèsuǒ zài wòshì lǐbian/lǐ.厕所在卧室里边/里。

Wǒ de chē zài qiáo shàngbian/shàng huàile.我的车在桥上边/上坏了。

Wǒ māma de bàngōngshì zài pàichūsuǒ pángbiān.我妈妈的办公室在派出所旁边。 
My mother’s office is next to the police station.

Dìtiězhàn zài yóujú hé yínháng zhōngjiān.地铁站在邮局和银行中间。 
The subway station is between the post office and the bank.

Note that, in the last example, zhōngjiān 中间 links two nouns, yóujú 邮局 (post office) and yínháng 银行 (bank). Whenever something is spatially located between two other things, their relationship is described in Chinese using the structure zài 在 A hé 和 B zhōngjiān 中间(lit., at A and B between).

Location and Time: Word Order
When location and time expressions are both used in a sentence, the time expression usually comes first, then the location word, and finally the main verb.

Wǒ měitiān qù gōngyuán pángbiān de xuéxiào shàngxué.我每天去公园旁边的学校上学。 
I go to school next to the park every day.

Nàge xiǎo péngyou měitiān zài wǒmen fángzi qiánbian wán.那个小朋友每天在我们房子前边玩。 
That child (lit., little friend) plays in front of our house every day.

Location + Personal Pronoun
When a location word is used with a personal pronoun, the pronoun is traditionally followed by the particle de 的: Tā de māma zài tā de qiánbian. 他的妈妈在他的前边。(His mother is in front of him.) resulting in the following pattern: zài 在 + pronoun + de 的 + location word.

In this case, de 的 turns tā 他into a possessive pronoun and the location word qiánbian 前边acts as a noun (lit., [his] front) rather than as a preposition (in front). In colloquial conversation, however, de 的 is usually dropped and the pronoun is used on its own as in Tā de māma zài tā qiánbian. 他的妈妈在他前边。 (His mother is in front of him.)

Let’s look at a few more examples.

Wǒ de péngyoǔ zài wǒ (de) pángbiān.我的朋友在我(的)旁边。 
My friend is next to me.

Lǎoshī zhàn zài tāmen (de) hòubian.老师站在他们(的)后边。
